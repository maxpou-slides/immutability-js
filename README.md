# Immutability for functional javascript - Maxence POUTORD [@_maxpou](https://twitter.com/_maxpou)

Description: If you follow JavaScript trends, you may have already heard about Functional Programming. This old paradigm is coming back for a very good reason: it is expected to reduce bugs and help you sleep at night. 
We will focus on one of the pillars of Functional Programing: Immutability. 
What are the benefits of Immutability? How to execute an immutable operation in plain JavaScript? How libraries such as Immutable.js and Mori work under the hood (immutable data structures)?
